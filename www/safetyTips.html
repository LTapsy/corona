                    <li>The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.</li>
                    <li><b>The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).</li>
                        <li>Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Wash your hands</b> often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.</li>
                    <li>If soap and water are not readily available, <b>use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</b> Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.</li>

                    <li><b>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth</b> with unwashed hands.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Avoid close contact</b> with people who are sick</li>
                    <li>Put <b>distance between yourself and other people</b> if COVID-19 is spreading in your community. This is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Cover your mouth and nose</b> with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>If you are sick:</b> You should wear a facemask when you are around other people (e.g., sharing a room or vehicle) and before you enter a healthcare provider’s office. If you are not able to wear a facemask (for example, because it causes trouble breathing), then you should do your best to cover your coughs and sneezes, and people who are caring for you should wear a facemask if they enter your room. Learn what to do if you are sick.</li>
                    <li><b>If you are NOT sick: </b> You do not need to wear a facemask unless you are caring for someone who is sick (and they are not able to wear a facemask). Facemasks may be in short supply and they should be saved for caregivers.</li>
